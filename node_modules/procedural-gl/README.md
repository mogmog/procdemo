Procedural GL JS is a library for creating 3D map experiences on the web, written in JavaScript and WebGL. It is built on top of [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

It provides an easy-to-use, but powerful framework to allow beautiful landscapes of the outdoors to be embedded into web pages. It loads super-fast and is optimized for mobile devices.

[Demo](https://www.procedural.eu/map/) | [Docs](https://www.procedural.eu/) | [Overlay playground](https://www.procedural.eu/overlays.html) | [Elevation data](https://www.nasadem.xyz) | [Source](https://github.com/felixpalmer/procedural-gl-js)

Key features
============

- Novel GPU powered level-of-detail system gives butter-smooth rendering, including on mobile
- Stream in standard raster imagery tiles. Supports map tiles from a variety of providers
- Easily include elevation data for 3D terrain
- Powerful overlay capabilities. Draw crisp markers and lines
- Well-thought-out API, complex applications can be built without needing to deal with 3D concepts
- Great UX and intuitive controls, mouse-based on desktop & touch-based on mobile
- Tiny filesize means library is parsed fast. Package size is less than THREE.js thanks to code stripping

Install
=======

    npm install procedural-gl

Usage
=====

```javascript
import Procedural from 'procedural-gl';

// Choose a DOM element into which the library should render
const container = document.getElementById( 'container' );

// Configure datasources
const datasource = {
  provider: 'maptiler',
  // To get a free key, use https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/?ref=procedural
  apiKey: 'GET_AN_API_KEY_FROM_MAPTILER'
};

// Initialize library and optionally add UI controls
Procedural.init( { container, datasource } );
Procedural.setRotationControlVisible( true );

// Load real-world location
const montBlanc = { latitude: 45.8326364, longitude: 6.8564201 };
Procedural.displayLocation( montBlanc );
```

Connecting to a datasource
--------------------------

To actually load data using a library you will need to connect to a source of data. The quickest way to get setup is to register for a [free account with MapTiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/?ref=procedural) and then use the API key as shown above.

For detailed instructions for setting up the datasource, [see this page in the wiki](https://github.com/felixpalmer/procedural-gl-js/wiki/Data-sources)
